The objective of the project was to summarize the given source text. We implemented this task by fine-tuning the existing T5 (Text-To-Text) transfer model. We used T5 as our base language model. T5 in many ways is one of its kind transformers architecture that not only gives state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks but also has a very radical approach to NLP tasks.
